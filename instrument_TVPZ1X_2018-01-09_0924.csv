ACC expects and intends that all UDS forms will be attempted on all subjects, but we realize this may be impossible when the patient is terminally ill, or when there is no co-participant, or for other reasons. However, for a subject to be included in the UDS database, <b>Forms Z1, A1, B4, B8, B9, C1/C2, D1, and D2</b> must be submitted, even though these forms may include some items with missing data. An explanation is required below for forms that are not submitted.

KEY: If the specified form was not completed, please enter one of the following codes: 

95 = Physical problem
96 = Cognitive/behavior problem
97 = Other problm
98 = Verbal refusal",,,,,,,,,,,,,
